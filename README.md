# Tesina Parse And Calcute Hull (pach)
_Lucio Nardelli - Director Hernán Ponce de León_

 Parse logs (as XES File) and calculate the minimum convex hull using Pyhull (https://pythonhosted.org/pyhull)
 of the  "acumulative Parikh's vector" of the the events in the traces.

 It has the ability to handle large logs with two different high-level techniques: projection and sampling

 Code is messy, as it is a WIP.
